# dawnet-client

The `DAWNet client` is a python3 pip package.  It is used to create `DAWNet remotes`.  Remotes are scripts created with the python client.  The client allows a user to register remote functions with the DAWNet discovery server. After a function has been registered it can then be triggered remotely from `DAWNet plugin.

::: warning
NOTE: The plugin is in an active, pre-alpha state.  It has only been tested on Ableton 11 on MAC M1.

## Installation

```python
pip install dawnet-client --upgrade
```

## Tests

from the root of the source code dir run:
```python
pip uninstall dawnet-client -y && pip install -e . && pytest -s
```

## Usage

This is a simple example of a DAWNet remote script created using the dawnet-client.  The script defines an arbitrary function that takes two arguments, an integer and a DAWNetFilePath.  The function is registered with the DAWNet discovery server.  The script then connects to the DAWNet discovery server and waits for a remote trigger.

```python
import dawnet_client.core as dawnet
from dawnet_client import DAWNetFilePath

# The token is generated by the DAWNet plugin.  
# It is used by the discovery server to associate the remote with the plugin.
TOKEN="0715c132-0b31-406e-b562-9206c479a48a" 

# The registered method can be named anything. Note that the method must be `async`.  
# All parameters must be type hinted.  
# 4 parameter types are supported: int, float, str, DAWNetFilePath
# DAWNetFilePath is a special type. When the file is sent to the remote, it is intercepted by the system and 
# transported to a temp dir on the remote.  In this case the variable `b` is local path to the file.
async def arbitrary_method(a: int, b: DAWNetFilePath):
    try: 
        # -----------------------------------------
        # This is where you can write custom code to operate on the input params.
        # ex param `a` could be the number of variations created from param `b` using something like MusicLM
        # -----------------------------------------
        
        # This is how you send results back to the plugin, when processing is complete.
        await dawnet.results().add_file(b) 
        # This message is displayed in the plugin.
        await dawnet.results().add_message("This is a message XYZ")
        # The send method begins the transfer of results data back to the plugin.
        await dawnet.results().send()

        return True
    except Exception as e: 
        return f"Method encountered an error: {e}"


# The token generated by the plugin. 
dawnet.set_token(token=TOKEN)
# The name of the remote.  This is displayed in the plugin.
dawnet.set_name("My Remote Code")
# The description of the remote.  This is displayed in the plugin.
dawnet.set_description("This is not a real description.")
# Register the method with the discovery server.
dawnet.register_method("arbitrary_method", arbitrary_method)

# When a file is sent to the remote as a DAWNetFilePath, it will become available at this sample rate. 
dawnet.set_input_target_sample_rate(44100) #supported values [22050, 32000, 44100, 48000]
# When a file is sent to the remote as a DAWNetFilePath, it will become available at this bit rate. 
dawnet.set_input_target_bit_depth(16) #supported values [16, 24, 32]
# When a file is sent to the remote as a DAWNetFilePath, it will become available with this number of channels.
dawnet.set_input_target_channels(2) #supported values [1, 2] mono/stereo respectively
# When a file is sent to the remote as a DAWNetFilePath, it will become available in this format.
dawnet.set_input_target_format('wav') #supported values ["wav", "mp3", "aif", "flac"]

# When results are sent back to the plugin, they will be sent at this sample rate.
dawnet.set_output_target_sample_rate(44100)
# When results are sent back to the plugin, they will be sent at this bit rate.
dawnet.set_output_target_bit_depth(16)
# When results are sent back to the plugin, they will be sent with this number of channels.
dawnet.set_output_target_channels(2)
# When results are sent back to the plugin, they will be sent in this format.
dawnet.set_output_target_format('wav')

# This should be the last line of the script.  It connects to the discovery server and waits for a remote trigger.
dawnet.connect_to_server()
